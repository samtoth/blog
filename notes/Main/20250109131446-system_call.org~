#+title: System-call

System calls are how programs request services from the operating system


E.g:
 - Requesting memory
 - Accessing files
 - Running processes
 - Accessing concurrency features


System calls are implemented using[[id:6FD5E91E-37D3-44D9-9FCD-1B44B3E6E58A][ Interrupts]].

The system call ID and parameters are stored in designated registers. And then an interrupt is triggered. (instruction sometimes referred to as a trap)

The interrupt is handled by a specific system call routine in kernel mode code.

It then returns to running some user code - or getting on with doing something useful.

Sys-calls are a chance for operating system to get on with doing useful things that it needs to do.

Needs to be very efficient as sys-calls happen all the time.
