## Threads vs Processes

Threads share data, code and file handlers.
 - Have their own stack, registers and program counter. Called _execution context_

Threads have similar '_things_' as processes, similar state machine, Thread control block, thread table, Thread Id (Like PCB, and PID etc.)

Threads have less overhead for creating/switching/terminating
 - No need for protecting threads memory from one-another
Interthread communication much easier than interprocess 
 - But this comes with danger. Synchronising access to data
**DANGER** ^ this is very complicated/causes issues e.g. deadlocks
