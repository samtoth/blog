#+title: Interrupts

Programs running on a CPU need to be able to respond to events. Interrupts are the CPU's mechanism for allowing the operating system to do this.


Example:
 - Writing to file takes magnitudes longer than normal CPU executions
 - If it had to wait for IO calls to finish it would be wasting most of it's time.
 - Instead it sends a write requests, and gets interrupted when the long IO calls are finished



A sketch of the interrupt mechanism
 1. CPU is doing some work - i.e. runnings some process(es)
 2. An interrupt is signalled e.g. by some IO device
 3. The CPU records it's current state, switches to[[id:59AB3014-4436-4CEA-9E4C-B4E031B6202D][ Kernel-mode]] and 


*Interrupts may be nested* (interrupts can signal further interrupts)

Some critical code may be marked as not interruptable

This results in lots of complexity
