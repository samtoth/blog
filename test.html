<h2 id="recap-on-haskell-data-types-and-polynomials">Recap on Haskell
data types and polynomials</h2>
<p>As we learnt in the lectures, Haskell has a feature called algabraic
data types. What this means is that there are product types, the tuples
(including the empty tuple <code>()</code>), as well as sum types,
written in Haskell with the bar notation
<code>data MyType = A | B</code>. They can be thought of as something
like an ‘or’ type.(*1)</p>
<p>There exists an alternative notation for data types which hints at a
suggestion to something we are all familiar with from school:
Polnomials!</p>
<p>Instead of writing tuples <code>(a , b)</code>, we choose to write
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> × <em>b</em></span>, and instead of
sums such as <code>data Blah = Foo | Baz</code> we write <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em><em>o</em><em>o</em> + <em>B</em><em>a</em><em>z</em></span>.
Additionally, the empty tuple <code>()</code> is written as just <span
class="math inline">1</span>. This seems strange maybe at first sight;
however, when looking at finite types, you start to see the motivation:
Consider <code>Bool</code> as a 2 element type. In this alternative
notation we might write <code>Bool</code> as <span
class="math inline">𝟚</span>. After some consideration you might see
that the type <code>data Three = A Bool | B ()</code> has three possible
values… so now the notation <span class="math inline">𝟛 = 𝟚 + 1</span>
is starting to look very sensible indeed. (Consider what the type <span
class="math inline">𝟚 × 𝟙</span> represents… no prizes for getting that
it is equal to <span class="math inline">𝟚</span>)</p>
<p>Now almost every data type in haskell can be written as a combination
of products and sums (and function types (4*)), however, there is one
thorny case to consider - and sadly or happily, i’m not sure… these
outliers are the most intersting and usefull kinds of data types, namely
recursive types.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-data-types">Recursive data types</h2>
<p>When we write a recursive data type such as <code>[a]</code> (defined
for reference below), there doesn’t seem to be a good way to turn it
into a simple combination of products and sums of existing types or type
variables.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> [a] <span class="ot">=</span> [] <span class="op">|</span> (<span class="ot">::</span>) a [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(^^ not exactly real haskell)</p>
<p>I am hoping the answer to this question of how to represent that data
type mathmatically will give some insight onto why the foldr function
works as it does and how you can derive similar functions for the data
types you’ve cooked at home.</p>
<p>So… the solution is to write a polnomial function!!</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>L</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>(<em>X</em>) = 1 + <em>A</em> × <em>X</em></span></p>
<p>For a fixed type <code>A</code>, this list is a polnomial function in
1 variable, X. The reason why this is the right choice of polynomial is
that if you imagined the type when you replace X with the desired
recursive type, you get exactly the type you desire, <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em>(<em>A</em>) = 1 + <em>A</em> × <em>L</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.
You might then recognise that the type we desire is a fixed point for
this function (although it doesn’t matter if you have never encountered
fix points before).</p>
<p>We shall now go on to explain, using Haskell code, how the list type
relates to this polynomial and how this relationship gives us the foldr
function for free!</p>
<h2 id="algebra-for-polynomials">Algebra for Polynomials:</h2>
<p>First a quick definition. An algebra for one of our polnomial type
functions (call it <code>F</code>) is a particular choice of type, call
it <code>b</code>, and function: <code>F b -&gt; b</code>. Very simple
so far!</p>
<p>Unfolding this definition in particular for lists, this means we want
a function: <span
class="math display">1 + <em>a</em> * <em>b</em> → <em>b</em></span> Now
take a moment to understand how each of the following types are
equivalent to the type above (hint think about how you would define them
all as functions in haskell):</p>

</details>
<p><span
class="math display">(<em>a</em>→<em>b</em>→<em>b</em>) × <em>b</em></span></p>
<p>For reasons that will become aparent very shortly (and you might
already have spotted) this is the form of the type that we want.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> a b <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We say that the haskell type <code>[a]</code> is the <em>initial</em>
list algebra.</p>
<p>Firstly, lets validate that there is a sensible definition of
ListAlgebra for <code>[a]</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">listListAlg ::</span> <span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> a [a]</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>listListAlg <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> (<span class="ot">::</span>) []</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This feels like a very sensible definition - which is always a good
sign.</p>
<p>Now onto what it means for something to be an initial algebra. An
algebra is initial when there is a map from it to any other arbritary
algebra. (*2)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">listListAlgInit ::</span> <span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> a b <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>listListAlgInit (<span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> _ empty) [] <span class="ot">=</span> empty</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>listListAlgInit (<span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> app empty) (x<span class="op">:</span>xs) <span class="ot">=</span> app x (listListAlgInit (<span class="dt">ListAlgebra</span> app empty) xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(*3)</p>
<p>We can read the above type as for any listAlgebra <code>b</code>
there is a function from <code>[a]</code> to <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>Et voila. We only have to a simple bit of rearranging and unfolding
and currying to get to the fact that this type is equivalent to
<code>foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps understanding and motivating the foldr function
and was interesting :)</p>
<p>Also note that we can pull this trick for any haskell data type we
like and find the ‘natural’ ‘fold’ function by looking at it’s type of
algebras. Maybe looking at the natural numbers and deriving the fold
function for them could be a useful exersize.</p>
hint: natural numbers are defined by the polynomial:

<h3 id="an-extra-a-lazy-thorn-in-the-side">An extra: A lazy thorn in the
side</h3>
<p>Lazyness in Haskell has a way of making the above story unfortunately
slightly untrue :( The particular gadget we have been talking about in
full technicality are <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/initial+algebra+of+an+endofunctor">initial
algebras of polynomial endofunctors</a>. But if you define a function
using foldr on an infinite list, haskell won’t be happy with you. The
reason for this is that laziness in haskell in a sense conflates
inductive and coinductive data types. A list in haskell can be both a
list or a stream. Most other languages either don’t have these infinite
(coinductive) data types or choose to explicitely seperate when a data
type can be infinite (total languages such as agda and idris and lean)
often by being able to define <code>data SuchAndSuch ...</code> and
<code>codata CoSuchAndSuch ...</code>. Semantically this can be achieved
using the categorical dual to initial algebras, the creatively named
final coalgebras. To go into detail is too much here but more info can
be found at <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/terminal+coalgebra+for+an+endofunctor">the
nlab</a>. <a
href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/07/data-and-codata.html">This blog
post</a> is also a very interesting read on the topic.</p>
<h3 id="technical-details">Technical details:</h3>
<p>(*1): If you want to learn more about this I would reccomend looking
up category theory and in particular trying to understand what it means
when a category is (bi)cartesian closed. In category theory speak tuples
correspond to finite products, sum types to finite coproducts and
function types to exponential objects. If you are interested in category
theory, I am always happy to chat about it in the discord :) - it’s my
favorite topics in maths/cs.</p>
<p>(*2): We can actually show that this is the only reasonable
definition (up to unique isomorphism). This happens because we really
want to place more restrictions on the type of map that counts as a map
of F-algebras <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebra+for+an+endofunctor">more
detail here</a>. We also would need to show that the map witnessing
initiality is unique (up to unique isomorphism). It is possible (by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense">generalised
abstract nonsense</a>) to show that the uniqueness of this map gives us
the uniqueness of the initial algebra.</p>
<p>(*3): This could be equally - or arguably better-ly - implemented as
a haskell typeclass, getting rid of a lot of noise in the definition.
But keeping it simple with a datatype seemed like a reasonable
tradeoff.</p>
<p>(*4): Function types are written as exponentials in this notation
<code>a -&gt; b</code> corresponds to <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em><sup><em>a</em></sup></span>. Again, it is
worth verifying to yourself why this is the case by using finite types
as intuition. E.g. how many functions are there from Bool to Bool.</p>
