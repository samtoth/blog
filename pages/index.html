    Hello! I am a Computer Scientist with an interest in Functional Programming, Proof Assistants and Categories. I am currently a student a the University of Nottingham, but in my free time (and past life) I play the trombone and write music. On this site you can find a mix of blog posts and some current projects I am working on
